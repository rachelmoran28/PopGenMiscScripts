There are 28 sets (excluding the Outgroup)
Going to calculate D and f4-ratio values for 3276 trios
Done permutations
The VCF contains 700502 variants
Going to use block size of 35024 variants to get 20 Jackknife blocks
WARNING: the sample Aeneus_granadas_cave is in the VCF but not assigned in the SETS.txt file
